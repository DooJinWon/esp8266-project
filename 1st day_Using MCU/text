Development Log – Initial ESP8266 Setup

Today, I became familiar with the ESP8266 development environment and basic operation.
I successfully set up the ESP8266 board using the Arduino IDE and verified the toolchain, drivers, and board configuration. After resolving initial connection and upload issues, I confirmed stable firmware upload and serial communication.

As a first basic project, I implemented and tested the Blink example to verify correct GPIO control and board functionality. The onboard LED blinked as expected, confirming that the microcontroller, upload process, and runtime behavior were working properly.

Next, I extended the basic Blink example by integrating Wi-Fi functionality. The ESP8266 was configured to connect to a local 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi network, and connection status was verified through serial output. This step helped clarify the importance of Wi-Fi frequency compatibility and proper serial baud rate configuration.

Building on this, I implemented a simple web server running directly on the ESP8266. Through a web browser on a mobile device or computer, I was able to dynamically control the LED blinking interval over Wi-Fi. This project demonstrated core IoT concepts, including wireless communication, remote parameter control, and non-blocking firmware design using timing based on millis() rather than delay-based blocking.

Overall, today’s work provided hands-on experience with the ESP8266, covering hardware setup, Wi-Fi communication, web-based control, and basic embedded system debugging. These foundational experiments serve as a basis for the next development stage, which will focus on sensor integration, low-power operation using Deep Sleep mode, and reliable data transmission to a server.
